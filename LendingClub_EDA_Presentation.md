- Opportunity for risk-based decision improvements

---

## Slide 5: Key Risk Factors Identified

# Critical Default Drivers

## 🏆 **Loan Grade (Primary Risk Indicator)**
- **Grade A:** ~5-7% default rate (Low Risk)
- **Grade G:** ~30-35% default rate (High Risk)
- **Risk Spread:** ~25-30 percentage points

## 💰 **Interest Rate Impact**
- **High Rates (Top 20%):** ~25-30% default rate
- **Low Rates (Bottom 20%):** ~8-10% default rate
- **Strong correlation** between rates and risk

## 📊 **Debt-to-Income Ratio**
- **High DTI (>25%):** Significantly higher defaults
- **Key indicator** of repayment capacity

---

## Slide 6: Risk Analysis Results

# Univariate Analysis Findings

## 🔢 **Numerical Variables**
- **Loan Amount:** Higher amounts show moderate risk increase
- **Interest Rate:** Strong positive correlation with defaults
- **Annual Income:** Lower income segments at higher risk
- **DTI Ratio:** Above 20% threshold increases risk significantly

## 📋 **Categorical Variables**
- **Loan Grade:** Most powerful predictor (A-G scale)
- **Employment Length:** Longer employment reduces risk
- **Home Ownership:** Mortgage holders show lower default rates
- **Loan Purpose:** Debt consolidation shows higher risk

---

## Slide 7: Bivariate Analysis Insights

# Variable Relationships with Defaults

## 📊 **Grade vs Default Rate**
```
Grade A: ~7% defaults   (Low Risk)
Grade B: ~12% defaults  (Moderate Risk)  
Grade C: ~18% defaults  (Elevated Risk)
Grade D: ~25% defaults  (High Risk)
Grade E-G: >30% defaults (Very High Risk)
```

## 💵 **Interest Rate Segments**
- **<10%:** 8% default rate
- **10-15%:** 15% default rate  
- **>15%:** 25%+ default rate

## 🏠 **Income vs Risk Pattern**
- Lower income quartiles show 2x higher default rates
- Income verification reduces risk by ~3-5%

---

## Slide 8: Business Recommendations

# Strategic Action Plan

## 🎯 **1. Loan Approval Criteria**
- **Implement tiered approval** based on grade + DTI
- **Stricter review** for grades D, E, F, G
- **Additional documentation** for high-risk segments
- **Enhanced verification** for income claims

## 💰 **2. Pricing Strategy**
- **Risk-based pricing** model implementation
- **Interest rate adjustments** to reflect true risk
- **Loan amount limits** for high-risk applicants
- **Premium pricing** for grades E-G

---

## Slide 9: Risk Management Framework

# Proposed Risk Assessment System

## 🎯 **Risk Scoring Model**
### Low Risk (Score: 0-30)
- Grades A-B, DTI <15%, Rate <10%
- **Expected Default:** 5-10%

### Medium Risk (Score: 31-60)  
- Grades B-C, DTI 15-25%, Rate 10-15%
- **Expected Default:** 12-20%

### High Risk (Score: 61-100)
- Grades D-G, DTI >25%, Rate >15%
- **Expected Default:** 25%+

## 📊 **Validation Results**
- Framework successfully differentiates risk levels
- Clear risk progression across categories

## Slide 10: Portfolio Management

# Risk Mitigation Strategies

## 📊 **Portfolio Monitoring**
- **Monthly tracking** of default rates by segment
